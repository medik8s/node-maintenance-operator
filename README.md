# Node Maintenance Operator (NMO)

<p align="center">

</p>

The node-maintenance-operator (**NMO**) is an operator generated from the [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).
NMO was *previously* developed under [KubeVirt](https://github.com/kubevirt/node-maintenance-operator), and this repository is the up-to-date version of NMO.

The purpose of this operator is to watch for new or deleted custom resources (CRs) called `NodeMaintenance` which indicate that a node in the cluster should either:
  - `NodeMaintenance` CR created: move node into maintenance, cordon the node - set it as unschedulable, and evict the pods (which can be evicted) from that node.
  - `NodeMaintenance` CR deleted: remove node from maintenance and uncordon the node - set it as schedulable.

> *Note*:  The current behavior of the operator is to mimic `kubectl drain <node name>`.

## Build and run the operator

There are three ways to run the operator:

- Deploy the latest version, which was built from the `main` branch, to a running OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster.
- Deploy the last release version from OperatorHub to a running Kubernetes cluster.
- Build and deploy from sources to a running or to be created OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster.

### Deploy the latest version

After every PR merge to `main` branch images were build and pushed to `quay.io`.
For deployment of NMO using these images you need:

- a running OpenShift cluster, or a Kubernetes cluster with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) installed.
- `operator-sdk` binary installed, see https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/.
- a valid `$KUBECONFIG` configured to access your cluster.

Then run `operator-sdk run bundle quay.io/medik8s/node-maintenance-operator-bundle:latest`

### Deploy the last release version
Click on `Install` in the Node Maintenance Operator page under [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/operator/node-maintenance-operator), 
and follow its instructions to install the [Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)](https://olm.operatorframework.io/), and the operator.

### Build and deploy from sources
Follow the instructions [here](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/tutorial/#3-deploy-your-operator-with-olm) for deploying the operator with OLM.
> *Note*: Webhook cannot run using `make deploy`, because the volume mount of the webserver certificate is not found.

## Setting Node Maintenance

### Set Maintenance on - Create a NodeMaintenance CR

To set maintenance on a node a `NodeMaintenance` custom resource should be created.
The `NodeMaintenance` CR spec contains:

- evictionTimeout: The timeout for pods eviction by drain/delete before giving up. Zero means infinite, and the default value is 30s.
- nodeName: The name of the node which will be put into maintenance mode.
- reason: The reason why the node will be under maintenance.

Create the example `NodeMaintenance` CR found at `config/samples/nodemaintenance_v1beta1_nodemaintenance.yaml`:

```sh
$ cat config/samples/nodemaintenance_v1beta1_nodemaintenance.yaml
apiVersion: nodemaintenance.medik8s.io/v1beta1
kind: NodeMaintenance
metadata:
  name: nodemaintenance-sample
spec:
  evictionTimeout: "30s"
  nodeName: node02
  reason: "Test node maintenance"

$ kubectl apply -f config/samples/nodemaintenance_v1beta1_nodemaintenance.yaml

$ kubectl logs <nmo-pod-name>

### Set Maintenance off - Delete the NodeMaintenance CR

To remove maintenance from a node, delete the corresponding `NodeMaintenance` (or `nm` which is a shortName) CR:

```sh
$ kubectl delete nm nodemaintenance-sample
nodemaintenance.nodemaintenance.medik8s.io "nodemaintenance-sample" deleted
$ kubectl logs <nmo-pod-name>
2022-02-24T14:27:35.332Z INFO controller-runtime.manager.controller.nodemaintenance Reconciling NodeMaintenance {"reconciler group": "nodemaintenance.medik8s.io", "reconciler kind": "NodeMaintenance", "name": "nodemaintenance-sample", "namespace": ""}
time="2022-02-24T14:27:35Z" level=info msg="Maintenance taints will be removed from node node02"
time="2022-02-24T14:27:35Z" level=info msg="Applying medik8s.io/drain taint remove on Node: node02"
...
```

## NodeMaintenance Status

The `NodeMaintenance` CR can contain the following status fields:

```sh
$ kubectl get nm nodemaintenance-sample -o yaml
apiVersion: nodemaintenance.medik8s.io/v1beta1
kind: NodeMaintenance
metadata:
  name: nodemaintenance-sample
spec:
  nodeName: node02
  reason: Test node maintenance
status:
  drainProgress: 40
  evictionPods: 5
  lastError: "Last failure message"
  lastUpdate: "2022-06-23T11:43:18Z"
  pendingPods:
  - pod-A
  - pod-B
  - pod-C
  phase: Running
  totalpods: 19
```

`drainProgress` shows the percentage completion of draining the node.

`evictionPods` is the total number of pods up for eviction, before the node entered maintenance mode.

`lastError` represents the latest error if any for the latest reconciliation.

`lastUpdate` is the last time the status has been updated.

`pendingPods` is a list of pending pods for eviction.

`phase` is the representation of the maintenance progress and can hold a string value of: Running|Succeeded.
The phase is updated for each processing attempt on the CR.

`totalPods` is the total number of pods, before the node entered maintenance mode.

## Debug
### Collecting cluster data with must-gather

Use NMO's must-gather from [here](https://github.com/medik8s/node-maintenance-operator/tree/main/must-gather) to collect related debug data.

## Tests

### Run code checks and unit tests

`make check`

### Run e2e tests

1. Deploy the operator as explained above
2. run `make cluster-functest`

## Releases

### Creating a new release

For new minor releases:

  - create and push the `release-0.y` branch.
  - update OpenshiftCI with new branches!

For every major / minor / patch release:

  - create and push the `vx.y.z` tag.
  - this should trigger CI to build and push new images
  - if it fails, the manual fallback is `VERSION=x.y.z make container-build-and-push-community`
  - make the git tag a release in the GitHub UI.
